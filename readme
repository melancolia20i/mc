	~ Description:
	'mc' is a morse encoder and decoder written in x86_64 for the seek of learning, yet it works
	perfectly even though nobody is ever going to use this jaja

	~ Usage
	$ make
	$ ./mc [mode] "[message]"

	where mode can either be 'm' for translating morse code into text or 't' for doing the opposite

	~ minor issues
	when the mode selected is 'm', the user will have to add a trailing space to the message since
	whenever a whitespace is found the code previous to that space is translated, if no space is added
	the last code will not be taken into account.
